Today more than 97 percent of the world's supercomputers (including the complete top 10), more than 80 percent of all smartphones, many millions of desktop computers, around 70
percent of all web servers, a large chunk of tablet computers, and several appliances (dvdplayers, washing machines, dsl modems, routers, self-driving cars, space station laptops...) run Linux.

Linux is by far the most commonly used operating system in the world. Linux kernel version 4.0 was released in April 2015.

Its source code grew by several hundred thousand lines (compared to version 3.19 from February 2015) thanks to contributions of
thousands of developers paid by hundreds of commercial companies including Red Hat,Intel, Samsung, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, IBM, Novell, Qualcomm, Nokia, Oracle, Google, AMD and even Microsoft (and many more).
